1.By analyzing data mean and medain, values more or less same by mean that the data is distributed very evenly so data is good va, std,std.err count is also good with data.
2.Mice were equally distributed with weight, age, days tested on all medications with equal count of Male and Female mice.
3.By analyzing with bar graphs comparing with drug with testing on mice Capomulin is working good and second in place is Ramicane.
4.By analyzing with bar graphs comparing with drug with testing on mice Propriva is last in list(not wrking effectively).
5.Comaratively with all the data Infubinol's potential has some outliers plotted with box plots.
